Rocketserino is based on the idea that more people should have access to space.
As of now, it's very difficult for many educational institutions and individuals
who want to perform small experiments in space to do so. Their best shot is some
type of competition that some organization holds to send a small satellite up with
an existing mission. Because of tight mass budgets on most space missions, this is
very rare, and normally, only one group can send an experiment. We plan to change
that by making sounding rocket launches drastically cheaper by cutting down the
fuel costs for getting through the lower atmosphere and using consumer electronics
instead of specialized equipment.
